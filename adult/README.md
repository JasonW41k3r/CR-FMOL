This folder contains code for running experiments on Adult dataset. 

Here we don't provide scripts for automatic plotting or adversarial attacks. Interested users can modify based on our code and run their desired experiments.

Note that we follow the same experimental setting in *Agnostic Federated Learning* paper and *Fair Resource Allocation in Federated Learning* paper, where there are only two users each representing the 'PhD' and 'non-PhD' domain.

For details, see the Appendix of our submission.
