This folder contains scripts and code for generating Figure 4 plots (cifar-10 dataset experiments) in a rather automatic way (default settings are provided and users just need to run the bash script without the need to understand how the commandline arguments work). 

*With small modifications on corresponding shell scripts and code for plots, interested user can also generate figures on e.g. Fashion-MNIST dataset.
